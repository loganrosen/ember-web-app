# What is Web App?

From [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)

> Progressive web apps use modern web APIs along with traditional progressive enhancement strategy to create cross-platform web applications. These apps work everywhere and provide several features that give them the same user experience advantages as native apps.

This Ember addon helps you configure and manage the [Web App Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) to create a _Progressive Web App_.

The Manifest is only one part of PWAs, when integrating [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) into application you can use [Ember Service Worker](http://ember-service-worker.com/) addon.

It also supports _browserconfig_ and set of _meta_ tags for non-standard vendor implementations.
